Nepi Jano! Google Chrome extension 
=======

Nepi Jano! is a Google Chrome extension that allows read paid content on [www.sme.sk](http://www.sme.sk).


##How it works
If you have an iOS or Andorid [www.sme.sk](http://www.sme.sk) application you can read also content that regular web user can't read.
They are using simple [webview] to display the article content. So it was realy simple get the source url and find out that the only security they have is user agent string.
So what this extension does is that it basicly loads the content from mobile url and mask browser user agent string.
  
##Disclaimer
This extension was made only for test purposes. 
Please buy [Piano](http://www.piano.sk) subscription. You wil save hungry children in africa!
Seriosly. Dont be an asshole and buy subscription.
