=======

##How to used it
Just install extension and click on some paid link on [www.sme.sk](http://www.sme.sk) and wait for it...

##How it works
If you have an iOS or Andorid [www.sme.sk](http://www.sme.sk) application you can read also sme.sk content that regular web users can't read.
They are using simple webview to display the article content. So it was realy simple get the source url and find out that the only security they have is user agent string.
What this extension does is that it basicly loads the content for mobile app and displays it insted the regulear content on web page.

##Disclaimer
This extension was made only for test purposes.
